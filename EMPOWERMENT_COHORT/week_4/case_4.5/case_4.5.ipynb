    "* The table is the most precise format: we can see the exact numbers for each continent, but it's difficult to quickly see what the data means\n",

It's harder to make non-pairwise comparisons though, like how Asia compares to all of the other continents combined though\n",
    "* The pie chart makes it easy to see that Asia has more than half of the world's population, and easier to see that we are comparing parts (continents) of a whole (the world), but it's harder to judge the relative difference between Africa and America or Africa and Europe (though the percentage labels help with this). Also, thin slices like \"Oceania\" look messy and might disappear completely. In the example shown, we lose the information on total numbers and only have percent values instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the bar chart is the most appropriate visualization for this data. Most people reach for pie charts, but pie charts are overused and often not a great way to present data. If the only message that we wanted to convey was that Asia has more than half the world's population, then the pie chart is acceptable, but in that case we should go for a much simpler version showing only Asia vs. the rest of the world, as shown below. But here, we want to know which continents are the most and least populous, not whether or not Asia has more than half of the world's population, and this is much more difficult to do with the pie chart without the percentages written there.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "GDP is a metric that has become controversial because it is a very crude way of measuring economic activity. However, it can provide an interesting lens to look at specific countries and how they relate to each other. After looking at correlations like \"people in richer countries live longer\" it's tempting to make a causation link (e.g. \"if poorer countries raise their GDP, their citizens will live longer\"), but correlation is not the same as causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that the USA and China dwarf most other countries in terms of GDP, and that Japan's once strong GDP growth has leveled off in the last few decades."

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "To presenting data well, you need to constantly keep two things in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose the correct way to visualize the data\n",
    "2. Make the story easy to understand by being careful with the presentation details such as titles and labels\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you saw that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bar charts are good for basic analysis, showing how categorical variables relate to numerical variables. In very specific circumstances, pie charts can also be used for this when you are interested in relative vs. absolute sizes\n",
    "* Scatterplots are used to show how to numerical variables relate to each other, and are good for looking at correlations\n",
    "* Line charts are almost always appropriate to show how continuous data changes over time\n",
    "* Box plots are a great tool if you need to show more than a basic summary (such as an average), but you don't want to plot the full distribution of each variable (which can be cumbersome and overly detailed)\n",
    "\n",
    "You also saw how important it is to get all of the details right when presenting data. It's very common for people to use wrong or misleading labels, or to use titles that don't add anything to the visualization. Always be careful that you are using the correct units, and clearly labeling what these are, while using the title to summarize the message behind the data."
