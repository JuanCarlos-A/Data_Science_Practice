Up until this point, we have been focused on analyzing data from an *empirical* perspective - that is, working with tangible data points in Python. However, more advanced study of the data science arena (such as with hypothesis testing & inference, predictive modeling, and machine learning) often requires some *theoretical* background as well, where we work with abstractions of the truth that aren't completely bound by the data we have. This case will address both."

    "$$\\frac{\\sum(x_i-\\mu)^2}{N}$$\n",

For instance, if the mean is 5 and $x_i$ is 11, then you have to subtract 5 from 11. You then raise the resulting number to the second power and repeat the process for all the numbers in your dataset. Then, you sum up all these values (that's what the Greek letter $\\Sigma$, uppercase *sigma*, means) and divide the sum by $N$, which is the number of elements in the dataset (we do this to make this quantity into an average).\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why $(x_i-\\mu)$ is raised to the second power is because for values of $x_i$ that are less than the mean, this value is negative, so when you sum across all of these values, the negative values would cancel out the positive ones and give us zero! You can therefore think of the standard deviation as the average deviation from the mean to any point in the dataset, either to the left or to the right.\n",

    "We take the square root of the whole thing to bring it back to the same units that our dataset uses.

Notice however that we can't directly assert that there is a *causal* relationship between being a smoker and higher charges; based on the data we have, we can only say that these variables are at most correlated (see [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3587) for an in-depth discussion of the difference between causation and correlation)."

    "* The charges are fairly strongly positively correlated for BMI ($R=0.78$). This agrees with what we see on the scatter plot. We can also immediately see that there is some spread away from the central trend, which is why the $R$ value is not perfect.\n",
    "* There is a small negative correlation between age and charges. This indicates that as age increases, charges decrease. The scatter plot clearly shows two different groups within the data. We see that after the age of 40, charges are generally lower. However, within each of these groups, `charge` seems to increase with `age`. This indicates that the correlation between these variables is not particularly indicative of a linear trend [if we don't account for the presence of these clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)."

    "## Probability theory and distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we have been concerned with calculating statistical values which give insight into the data we already have; i.e. we have been taking a more *empirical* approach. However, we often have to be forward-looking and also predict the likelihood of future events, which is more *theoretical* in nature. We had a sampling of this in Exercise 4, but here we will talk more in detail about distributions and some of the basic theory around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we were to plot the distribution of BMIs for the smokers in our dataset — that would give us a histogram. But a histogram is entirely based on a limited sample of past data, and doesn't allow us to directly make predictions about the general smoker population, *independent of our specific dataset*. To do this, we need a **probability density function (PDF)**, which is a theoretical construct that helps us compute the probability of where any randomly chosen smoker's BMI would fall, and which is not strictly beholden to the limits of our dataset (caveat: In order to use a PDF as an aid for inference, ie., to make general claims about a population using data from a sample, we need to pair it with some other techniques that make sure that the sample is representative of the whole).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we didn't say that the PDF can directly tell us the probability that a randomly chosen smoker's BMI would be exactly some given value; say, 30. The reason for this is because BMI is a *continuous* value rather than a *discrete* value; it can take on any decimal value, so the probability that a person's BMI is *exactly* 30 is pretty much zero. It's virtually guaranteed that what we think is a 30 BMI is actually a 29.99 BMI, or a 30.01 BMI, or even a 30.001 BMI. Either way, finding a person with a BMI of exactly 30 is like trying to find a unicorn."

    "\n",
    "Because of this, it makes more sense to compute the probability that a smoker's BMI lies within some range; say, between 29 and 31. The PDF is perfectly made for this - specifically, if we plot the PDF on a standard 2-dimensional coordinate plane (with an $x$-axis and $y$-axis), this probability is the area of the region that lies under the PDF and above 0 (the $x$-axis), with $x$ values between 29 and 31. For those of you familiar with calculus, this is called the **area under the curve**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting consequence of this property of the PDF is that the total area under the PDF and above the $x$-axis, with no limits on what the $x$ values can be, has to be 1 (because the probability of an event has to lie between 0 and 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most famous distributions is the **normal distribution**, for which the mean, median, and mode are all equal and which is symmetric around the median. This distribution has a high peak in the center and tapers off as we move towards the left and right ends."

    "In this case, you saw that we can analyze historical data to understand the trends within it, and use those trends and some theoretical understanding of probability and statistics to predict the likelihood of future events. Key points include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Summary statistics can be used to quickly indicate where the \"center\" of a dataset is, or how spread out the dataset is.\n",
    "3. We can investigate correlations between variables. This is especially useful during exploratory data analysis, and when (as you will see in future cases) building models that predict the value of one variable of interest based on several others.\n",
    "3. The probability density function is what allows us to move from the fully empirical world of histograms, which are an imperfect and limited representation of the entire population, to modeling and inferring characteristics of that population. The area under the PDF and above 0 between two specific $x$-values $a$ and $b$ gives the probability that a randomly chosen sample from that population will have an $x$-value for that variable between $a$ and $b$.\n",
    "4. The normal distribution is a particularly special PDF which is perfectly symmetric and with its mean, median, and mode all equal, and is a pretty good fit to many natural phenomena."
