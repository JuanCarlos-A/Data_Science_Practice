    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context.** Recidivism is a measure of a former prisoner's likelihood to be re-arrested, re-convicted, or returned to prison with or without a new sentence during a three-year period following the prisoner's release. It has been used to study the performance and effectiveness of privately and publicly managed prisons. Recidivism rates among prisoners in the United States are high, with more than 60% of released prisoners re-offending within three years of release.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, prison reform programs have invested hundreds of millions of dollars per year on programs designed to reduce re-offense. However, implementing these programs is costly and evaluating them can be complex. Currently, policymakers are interested in evaluating a training program designed to reduce recidivism among paroled inmates. They have come to you for assistance in determining whether it is worthwhile.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** The policymakers want you to answer the following: **\"Will there be a reduction in recidivism if the proposed program were to be widely adopted?\"**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** The new program was piloted for a subset of parolees (recently released prisoners) from two prisons. New parolees at these two prisons were given the option to volunteer to participate in the recidivism reduction program. If we determine that the program is worthwhile, it would subsequently be scaled to all parolees from twenty-five eligible prisons in the federal penal system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case is structured as follows: you will (1) analyze the setup of the program and identify potential observational study design problems; (2) learn about matching and use it to correct for some of these problems; and finally (3) conduct exploratory data analysis to determine which features seem to account for most of the corrections/differences between the policymakers' study and our matched study."

    "The program we are evaluating in this case study was focused on vocational training and coping skills and was applied to  $n = 7105$ parolees from 2013 - 2015 in the southeastern United States. Participants were followed for 30 months after completing the program and identified as a \"responder\" if they did not commit a serious offense during that period, and a \"non-responder\" if they did. The data collected in the study has the form $(\\mathbf{X}_1,\\mathbf{Y}_1),(\\mathbf{X}_2,\\mathbf{Y}_2),\\dots, (\\mathbf{X}_n,\\mathbf{Y}_n)$, where $\\mathbf{X}_i$ is a vector containing several characteristics of parolee $i$ and $\\mathbf{Y}_i\\in\\{0,1\\}$ is a binary variable recording whether parolee $i$ was a responder or not (1 meaning re-offended, 0 meaning did not re-offend). Parolee characteristics are as follows:\n",

Use qualitative or quantitative analyses to discern whether those who are more likely to respond(and not re-offend) were more likely to enroll.

    "## Causal analysis via matching\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of matching is to group untreated individuals with treated individuals (here, the treatment is the recidivism reduction program) based on similarities in measured covariates to estimate the effect of treatment across the entire population. Assume that in addition to the *in-study data*, $ (\\mathbf{X}_1, \\mathbf{Y}_1),\\dots,  (\\mathbf{X}_n, \\mathbf{Y}_n)$ we have data from $m=55799$ prisoners released during the study period that either opted out of the study or were not eligible because they were not at one of the two prisons included in the study. Let us denote the characteristics of these *out of study* prisoners by $\\mathbf{X_1'}, \\mathbf{X_2'}, \\dots, \\mathbf{X_m'}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, for each *out of study* prisoner $j\\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$ with characteristics $\\mathbf{X}_j'$, our objective is to find an *in study* prisoner $i\\in\\{1,\\dots, n\\}$ with characteristics $\\mathbf{X}_i$, such that $\\mathbf{X}_i$ and $\\mathbf{X}_j'$ are as close as possible according to some **measure of distance**.  The intuition here is that if prisoner $i$ re-offended (i.e. $\\mathbf{Y}_i=1$) and $\\mathbf{X}_i$ is close to $\\mathbf{X}_j'$, then it is reasonable to estimate that the *out of study* prisoner $j$ will re-offend as well. Of course, this analysis is highly dependent on the measure we choose and some thought should be taken when selecting the appropriate measure. \n",
    "    \n",
    "For the purposes of this case, we will use the **euclidean distance**. Recall that given a pair of vectors $X=(x_1,\\dots, x_p)$ and $X'=(x_1',\\dots, x_p')$, the euclidean distance between $X$ and $X'$ is the value\n",

To explore differences in the study and non-study populations, we can consider building a model that predicts whether or not a subject was in the study using their baseline covariates. As a first step in building such a predictive model, though, let's do some basic exploratory data analysis and look at distributions of the covariates."

    "We examined matching as a means of analyzing the effectiveness of an observational recidivism study. We see that even though the study looked promising on the study population, this was primarily due to factors driving selection into the study. After adjusting for these factors, the program no longer appeared to be effective. We implemented the matching algorithm based on Euclidean distance between covariates."

    "In this case, we saw that one must take great care in analyzing observational data and pay particular attention to factors driving the construction of such studies. We learned that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sampling and treatment assignment methodology are key, as lack of prudence in these steps can lead to significant differences between the in-study and out-of-study data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Matching is one potential approach to analyzing such data. It is a conceptually simple approach but is also crude in that it does not weight covariates in terms of their importance for sample selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Several measures of distance can be used. In the future, it will be good to look at matching algorithms that weight covariates differently based on sensitivity to the objective variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this case we also covered some mathematical notions and manipulations that can be intimidating at first. Come back at this notebook at your own pace if you feel you need to. Remember, ask as many questions as possible to your instructors! "
