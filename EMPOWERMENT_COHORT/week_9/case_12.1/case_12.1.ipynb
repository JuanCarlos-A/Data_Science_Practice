    "**Business Context.** You are a data analyst at a large financial services firm that sells a diverse set of products. In order to make these sales, the firm relies on a call center where sales agents make calls to current as well as prospective customers. The company would like you to dive into their data to devise strategies to increase their revenue or reduce their costs. Specifically, they would like to double down on their most reliable customers, and to cut out sales agents who are not producing outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** The business would like to answer the following questions: **\"What types of customers are most likely to buy our product? And which of my sales agents are the most/least productive?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** The data is split across 3 tables: [`agent.xlsx`](data/agent.xlsx), [`call.xslx`](data/call.xlsx), and [`customer.xlsx`](data/customer.xlsx).\n",
    "\n",
    "The case is sequenced as follows: you will (1) learn the fundamentals of databases and SQL; (2) use SQL `SELECT` statements to identify potentially interesting customers; and (4) use SQL aggregation functions to compute summary statistics on your agents and identify the most/least productive ones."

    "\n",
    "While we have dealt with quite a number of data files in Excel, this solution is not very convenient for an organization with very large and complex datasets. First, Excel files [have](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3) a maximum size of 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns, and in practice the limit is much smaller than that because many personal computers can't handle that amount of data along with Excel's user interface at the same time. Furthermore, while having a single very large table may not be so bad, the situation becomes more complicated when you have to look up the data in that table in another very large table, which in turn references another table, etc. After a bunch of `VLOOKUP`s across several large tables, not only your Excel will crash, but you will also risk losing your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Spreadsheet icon](data/images/spreadsheet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that, collaboration is difficult in Excel - how would you allow your colleagues to work together on the same spreadsheet as you? One option could be to use Excel Online or Google Spreadsheets, but although these tools are excellent for collaboration on small datasets, they are not optimized for tasks like the one we are describing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the need to input data from online forms and use it in online dashboards that can be accessed by many people at once, and you quickly realize that this is definitely not a job for Excel anymore. You need a [**database engine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_engine) instead. This is a piece of software which is purpose-built to do all the things we have just mentioned in a very efficient and secure way.\n",

    "The [**database**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) is the classic location where modern organizations have chosen to store their data for professional use. An informal way to understand databases is as \"spreadsheets of spreadsheets\", that is, spreadsheets that link other (potentially many) spreadsheets. Their advantage over Excel is that databases have very strict rules on what is allowed and what not, thus preventing chaos and data loss, and have extremely good performance. Some popular database engines are:\n",
