    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Context.** You are a member of the business analytics team of *Simply Music*, a Florida-based musical instrument store that has been growing at a fast pace over the last few years. Management is keen to find out what the most popular items are and which locations are the most profitable, in order to adjust their marketing strategies and their stock logistics to increase sales and revenue. They also want to learn about the number of deliveries made outside Florida, since they are contemplating opening a new branch in another state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** You are tasked with creating a sales dashboard for management to use. This dashboard must display sales, revenue, and profit over time, and allow for queries across product, location, and customer age. From your previous meetings with the management, you know that they are interested in having these three broad questions answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How have our sales, revenue and profits evolved over time?\n",
    "2. What are the locations with the highest numbers of sales and profit?\n",
    "3. What are the items with the highest numbers of sales, profit and revenue across: product description, product type, product line, location, customer age group and state of delivery?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** We have been given a sample dataset of 5000 sales records from Simply Music, corresponding to the years 2018 and 2019. They ask you to create the dashboard with this sample data, and after this is done and your dashboard receives the management's approval, your team will have to connect it to an online database to feed it the real time data that comes from the company's sales tracking software. The sample table and the database share the same structure, so you don't have to worry about database management or creation. You will plan your dashboard and deploy it using [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop).\n",
    "\n",
    "The case is structured as follows: you will 1) understand the business process that the dashboard has to represent; 2) plan the dashboard layout and visualizations; and 3) create your dashboard using Tableau."

    "## Understanding the business process\n",
    "\n",
    "Data professionals are often required to extract valuable information from datasets without being given specific questions to answer. We usually address these cases with exploratory data analysis combined with domain knowledge. Other times, we can get the clients to articulate a limited set of questions. There is a third scenario, where the clients want to explore the data themselves in such a way that they can easily answer *ad-hoc* queries that can't possibly be known in advance. This is much more open-ended and requires us to intimately understand the natural structure of the data and likely queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to address this need is to create dashboards that organize and display all relevant business information, as well as various filters that users might want to have, while being fully extensible if required in the future. When you create dashboards, you define a set of relevant variables and feed them into interactive visualizations that the users can then filter at will to explore relationships between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dashboards work best when they mirror the business processes that underlie the data. It is always advised that you study the greater business context so that you can put yourself into the shoes of your end users (in this case, management) and deliver a product that is user-friendly and pertinent."

Since we want to know sales and total profit for each item, it makes sense to have a chart for sales (measured in number of items) and a chart for profit (measured in dollars).

Drill-down allows you to select one element of a chart and move to a lower level in the hierarchy. The following GIF may be helpful to understand this concept than a mere description in words (this is a bar chart of sales by item, with drill-down by line, type, and description):\n",

    "In this case, we looked at different types of visualizations and studied what kinds of data they are best suited to presenting. But we also saw that creating an analytical dashboard goes beyond this, and involves thinking about the concrete business questions that end users want to answer with the help of the dashboard. That is why we started by getting a grasp of the business process and the relevant dimensions and metrics, which informed the layout design and the choice of visualizations. Finally, we used Tableau to build and publish the dashboard using advanced options."

    "Dashboard creation should always start with a sound understanding of the business process and the business questions. You also need to be familiar with the different types of visualizations and their strengths and weaknesses, and keep some basic design principles in mind as well. This allows you to build a dashboard that is functional but also not cluttered. Some key ideas you might want to keep in mind for the future are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Dashboards are like restaurant menus.* They must be clear, straightforward and avoid overwhelming the user with too much information.\n",
    "* *Your visualizations should be organized hierarchically.* The most important questions come first. Secondary questions can be placed more to the right or bottom, and be presented in a smaller size\n",
    "* *Each visualization must answer a business question*, so it is always a good practice to label the chart or table with the question. You should also add explanatory text when you feel your users would appreciate it. However, if you find yourself adding too much text, then perhaps it is because your dashboard is not clear enough by itself and you should re-evaluate your layout or visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, drill-down and charts that double as page-level filters can save you a lot of space because you don't need to add more controls (like drop-down lists) to act as filters in the page. Not everything should be drillable though, because the dashboard should be kept as simple as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau is an excellent dashboarding tool, and its graphical user interface makes it one of the easiest to use. We encourage you to explore the many possibilities that it offers. This will help you expand your data visualization vocabulary and hone your dashboarding skills at the same time."
